==========

A number of JS plugins for Reaper, mostly for work on ambisonic B-format signals

Download and install:
---------------------

* Download plugins by hitting the zip button at https://github.com/lossius/js-plugins
* Unzip the resulting folder. You might want to rename it "trond-lossius-js-plugins" or something similar
* On Mac, open the folder ~/Library/Application Support/REAPER/Effects. In OSX 10.8 the Library folder might be hidden. If so, in Finder, hold down the ALT key while clicking the "Go" menu. This will cause the Library folder to show up as one of the folders.
* Copy the unzipped folder to the Effects folder, and (re)start Reaper.

* 2013-04-02: Initial commit of 6 modules for encoding mono and stereo sources as 1st order Bformat, and for pitch, roll and yaw manipulations of Bformat signals.

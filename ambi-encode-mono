desc: 1st order ambisonic encoding of mono signal

// This effect encodes a mono source to 1st order ambisonics WXYZ signals. It uses SpatDIF coordinate conventions rather than mathematical: 0 degrees azimuth is forward, +90 degrees azimuth to the right, 0 degrees elevation in the horisontal plane, +90 degrees elevation is upwards. The code is based on [1].

// Azimuth slider range is set to [-360,360] rather than [-180, 180] for more flexible scripting of rotating movements

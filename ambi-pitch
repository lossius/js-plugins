desc: Yaw rotation (about left-right axis) of ambisonic Bformat signal

// This effect performs 1st order rotation about the left-right axis of ambisonics WXYZ signals. According to aircraft principal axes [1] this is a pitch rotation, while Dave Malham [2] calls this "tumble". It uses SpatDIF coordinatec onventions: If we imagine an airplane with the tip poining forward, a tumble with positive abgle will make the tip point upwards. The code is based on [2].

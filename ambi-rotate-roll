desc: Roll rotation (about front-back axis) of ambisonic Bformat signal

// This effect performs 1st order rotation about the front-back axis of ambisonics WXYZ signals. According to aircraft principal axes [1] this is a roll rotation, while Dave Malham [2] calls this "tilt". It uses SpatDIF coordinate conventions rather than mathematical: It uses SpatDIF coordinatec onventions: If we imagine an airplane with the tip poining forward, a tumble with positive abgle will make the right wing point downwards while the left wing points upwards. The code is based on [2].
